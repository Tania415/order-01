  	  		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
  	  		<h4>To help our customers increase their margins by reducing their purchasing budget for electronic components and related products by an average of 10%.</h4><br>

  	  		 <p>
  	  		   <b>#1</b> The origin of what will become a new way to buy electronic components
               It all started in early 2020 with a virus and its consequences, which became known worldwide as Covid 19. In a very short time, the supply chain for electronic components suffered major disruptions. Prices began to soar, while for a time 70% of aircraft were grounded and the market was almost paralyzed.

               During the summer, when it was clear that the crisis was going to last for a long time and the request of a franchised English distributor with customers from Ireland to Poland, from Norway to Italy, from the Baltic States to Portugal, we started to study all the options, including those that were not usually practiced in this sector. We focused on the point of view of the clients who participated in the study. In the end, we came up with a solution that allowed these customers to reduce their budget for the purchase of electronic components by an average of 10%.

               The distributor initially "lost" half of its gross margin in financial costs linked to currency fluctuations (GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, ...), in costs directly linked to commercial activity, in costs directly linked to commercial management. And so on. All these costs have been reduced by 90%. This has allowed us to adapt the rates for customers who have chosen our solution to immediately start buying their electronic components "differently". And to save 10% on average, for the same products, exactly the same, the same major brands, always and exclusively new products in their original packaging. With their factory guarantees.

             </p><br>

             <p>
              <b>#2</b> Thereafter, 2020/2021<br>

              For a while, everything was going as well as it could in this almost apocalyptic covidic context. 

              Unfortunately, this distributor has had more and more cancellations of orders because it works mainly with customers in sectors that have been particularly affected by the coronavirus: aeronautics, automotive, travel. 

              Then there were too many unpaid bills from very large customers who refused the new formula proposed. This ended up having serious consequences, as it has for countless companies all over the world.</p><br>

              <p> 
              	<b>#3</b> Later, in the second half of 2021<br>

               The customers who had been involved in developing this new concept, a new way of buying electronic components in industrial quantities, asked us if we could take over. 

               The suppliers with whom we spoke during our consulting mission made more or less the same request. 

               We accepted the challenge and organized ourselves accordingly. Among other things, we set up a purchasing and logistics team in China. In order not to add Brexit side effects to those of Covid, orders are shipped directly to customers from Mainland China or from Hong Kong depending on the geographical origin of the products.
              </p><br>

              <p> 
              	<b>#4</b> now, 2022<br>

                We offer this service to other potential clients.

                If you've read this far, thank you, for a start. Then, a few final clarifications are in order: we are not a distributor of electronic components. We have no stock. We don't have technicians to advise you. We don't have engineers to help you develop a prototype. 

              </p><br>
              <div class="text0">
              <h5>Remarks on the above:</h5>
               <p><b>#</b> At least 8 times out of 10, the stock and immediate delivery argument is not relevant because you manage your production and you know perfectly well how to anticipate.<br>
                	
                 <b>#</b> At least 9 times out of 10, you don't need advice on how or what to order.
               </p><br>

               <p><i>"However, you have and will always need quality: to meet our customers' needs, we work with the same suppliers as the best electronic component distributors. 

               So we are doing a new job. We have completely invented this new profession thanks to our experience, our network of contacts in China, and the context created by this virus. With a mission: to help our customers to significantly reduce their budget for the purchase of electronic components.

               So, if you know exactly what you want, what you need, if you give us precise part numbers of the components, and if these products are actually available, because of the savings you will make from your first order, your financial management will never thank you enough for working with us."
